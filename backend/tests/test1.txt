          'is the perceived treatment eﬀects, not actual ones, regardless of '
          'whether they are correct or not which are fundamental to '
          'understanding choices. For example, if students rightly or wrongly '
          'perceive a negative treatment eﬀect of COVID19 on the returns to a '
          'college degree, this belief will have an impact on their future '
          'human capital decisions such as continuing with their education, '
          'choice of major, etc.. Our results underscore the fact that the '
          'COVID19 shock is likely to exacerbate socioeconomic disparities in '
          'higher education. This is consistent with ﬁndings regarding the '
          'impacts of COVID19 on K12 students. Kuhfeld et al., 2020 project '
          'that school closures are likely to lead to signiﬁcant learning '
          'losses in math and reading. However, they estimate heterogeneous '
          'eﬀects, and conclude that highperforming students are likely to '
          'make gains. Likewise, Chetty et al., 2020 ﬁnd that, post COVID, '
          'student progress on an online math program decreased signiﬁcantly '
          'more in poorer ZIP codes. Our analysis reveals that the '
          'heterogeneous economic and health burden imposed by COVID19 is '
          'partially responsible for these varying impacts. This suggests that '
          'by addressing the economic and health impacts imposed by COVID19, '
          'policy makers may be able to prevent COVID19 from widening existing '
          'gaps in higher education. 4.'},

          'students in our sample expect a decrease in their GPA due to the '
          'treatment versus only 7 expecting an increase. Additionally, on '
          'average, 13 of the participants delayed their graduation, 11 '
          'withdrew from a class during the spring semester, and 12 stated '
          'that their major choice was impacted by COVID19. An interesting and '
          'perhaps unanticipated result is that, on average, students are 4 '
          'percentage points less likely to enroll in an online class given '
          'their experience with online instruction due to the pandemic.7,8 '
          'However, there is a substantial amount of variation in terms of the '
          'direction of the eﬀect 31 47 of the participants are now more less '
          'likely to enroll in online classes. We explore this heterogeneity '
          'in more detail in the next section, but it seems that prior '
          'experience with having taken online classes somewhat ameliorates '
          'the negative experience the average treatment eﬀect for students '
          'with prior experience with online classes is a 2.4 percentage '

          'versus a 9.5 percentage points decline for their counterparts '
          'diﬀerence statistically signiﬁcant at the 0.1 level. This large '
          'variation in the treatment eﬀects of COVID19 is apparent in several '
          'of the other outcomes, such as study hours, where the average '
          'treatment eﬀect of COVID19 on weekly study hours is 0.9 that is, '
          'students spend 0.9 less hours studying per week due to COVID19. The '
          'interquartile range of the across subject treatment eﬀect '
          'demonstrates substantial variation, with the pandemic decreasing '
          'study time by 5 hours at the 25th percentile and increasing study '
          'time by 4 hours at the 75th. Overall, these results suggest that '
          'COVID19 represents a substantial disruption to students academic '
          'experiences, and is likely to have lasting impacts through changes '
          'in majorcareer and delayed gradua tion timelines. Students negative '
          'experiences with online teaching, perhaps due to the abruptness of '
          'the transition, also has implications for the willingness of '
          'students to take online classes in the future. Turning to Panel B '
          'in Table 2, we see that students current and expected labor market '
          'outcomes were substantially disrupted by COVID19. As for the '
          'extensive margin of current employment, on average, 29 of the '
          'students lost the jobs they were working at prior to the pandemic '
          '67 of the students were working prior to the pandemic, 13 of '
          'students had their internships or job oﬀers rescinded, and 61 of '
          'the students reported that a close family member had lost their job '
          'or experienced an income reduction. The last statistic is in line '

          'presents mediation analysis on the drivers of the underlying '
          'heterogeneity in the treatment eﬀects. The COVID19 pandemic serves '
          'as both an economic and a health shock. However, these shocks may '
          'have been quite heterogeneous across the various groups, and that '
          'could partly explain the heterogeneous treatment eﬀects we '
          'documented in the previous section. 5.1 Economic and Health '
          'Mediating Factors We proxy for the ﬁnancial and health shocks due '
          'to COVID19 by relying on a small but relevant set of '
          'exogenouspredetermined variables. Financial shocks are '
          'characterized based on whether a student lost a job due to COVID19, '
          'whether a students family members lost income due to COVID19, the '
          'change in a students monthly earnings due to COVID19, and the '
          'likelihood a student will fail to fully meet debt payments in the '
          'next 90 days. To measure health shocks, we consider a students '
          'belief about the likelihood that they will be hospitalized if they '
          'contract COVID19, a students belief about the likelihood that they '
          'will have contracted COVID19 by summer, and a students subjective '
          'health assessment. Finally, in order to summarize the combined '
          'eﬀect of each set of proxies, we also construct principal component '
          'scores as onedimensional measures of the ﬁnancial and health shock '
          'to students.14 Table 3 reports summary statistics of the diﬀerent '
